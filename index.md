## Lending Club

Since 2007, Lending Club has been helping millions of people take control of their debt, grow their small businesses, and invest for the future. Lending Club is a peer to peer lending company in which investors provide funds for potential borrowers and investors earn a profit depending on the risk they take. It is the world's largest marketplace in this space.  [a link to LendingClub website](https://www.lendingclub.com/)

## How Lending Club work?
1. Customers interested in a loan complete a simple application at LendingClub.com
2. Lending Club leverage online data and technology to quickly assess risk, determine a credit rating and assign appropriate interest        rates.
3. Approved applicants receive offers and can evaluate loan options
4. Investors can choice which type of loan and the return they wish to invest in

The entire process is online, using technology to lower the cost of credit and pass the savings back in the form of lower rates for borrowers and solid returns for investors. Here is the link to more details about LC.

## Analysis

## Conclusion
Lending club has a bright future ahead of itself. Based on my analysis, we see there is a high demand for peer-to-peer lending. Though I only limited the dataset from 2014 to 2018, each year Lending Club has continued to increases their market share via loan growth.  My analysis also shows that there is a wide spectrum of borrowers that are attracted to these type of loans.  Though most of the borrowers are concentrated in the mostly coasted city, we do have participation in all 50 years.  I hope Lending Club will be with us for a long time.
