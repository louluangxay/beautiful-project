## Here is where we can insert an image:

## How about a link?

And of course some text, and maybe [a link to LendingClub website](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/statistics.action)

## Or some code?

Some code might go here:

```
x <- 5 # Here's some R code
```

What if I just paste the HTML for a plotly plot?

We can do it with a line of markdown that looks like this (without the slashes - I haven't solved that problem just yet...):
```

```
# example

this is a first graph

{% include rshiny-iframe.html %}
